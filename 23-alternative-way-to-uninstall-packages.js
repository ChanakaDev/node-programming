/*

the 2nd method of uninstalling packages is as follows
=====================================================
(this approach is just like we have adding and removing packages in Flutter pubcpec.ymal)

(*) delete 'package-lock.json' file
(*) delete 'node_modules' folder
(*) remove dependency from 'package.json' file
(*) and then run the command 'npm install' or 'npm i' again
