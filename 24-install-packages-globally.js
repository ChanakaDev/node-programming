/*

how to install packages(modules) globally
=========================================

(*) you can run these commands even in your Terminal(macbook) or Cmd(windows).
(*) example: 'sudo npm install -g nodemon' (I ran this command in my macbook)

(*) you can use globally installed packages in any project
    examples: React, nodemon

important: you no need to install React globally, because 'npx' is there

(*) for example if you run 'npx create-react-app my-app', we don't need to install React globally
