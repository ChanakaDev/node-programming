/*

(*) if nodemon need to whatch your code before running
(*) you can add 

  "scripts": {
    "start": "node app.js",
    "dev": "nodemon app.js" // this line
},

to the scripts. 

(*) then, when you run the command 'npm start', nodemon view the code inside 'app.js'

however this didn't worked in my dev environment :(

(*) actually what does the nodemon do is, it runs the code automatically, when we do any change in 'app.js'
(*) you can see this functionality most of the times in 'ReactJS'
